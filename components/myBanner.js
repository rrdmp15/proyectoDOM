    paragraph:"When they first came on the scene in 2005 as Mother (before a necessitated 2007 name change), their syncopated boy/girl harmonies made them an indie-rock fusion between Scissor Sisters and The Pixies, with big swelling choruses that shifted between funk and twangy New Pornographers' power pop. That sound made them a buzz band, one now popular enough to headline Wednesday's Canadian Music Week show at the Phoenix â€” yet on this year's Eureka, out March 15, they sound like Cake and The Beta Band thrown in a blender, teetering on the dark edge of industrial goth rock.
